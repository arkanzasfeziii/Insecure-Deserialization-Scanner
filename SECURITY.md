# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

This project is a **security testing tool**. We take security and ethical use seriously.

### 🔍 Reporting Security Issues in the Tool Itself

If you discover a vulnerability **in the scanner tool** (e.g., command injection in the tool itself):

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub Issue
2. Email security reports to: `security@yourdomain.com` (replace with your contact)
3. Include:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation

We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

### ⚠️ Important Clarification

**This tool does NOT contain vulnerabilities to exploit** – it *detects* vulnerabilities in other systems. Reports about "exploiting systems with this tool" are not security issues in the tool itself.

## 🚫 Prohibited Activities

The following activities are **strictly prohibited** and may result in legal action:

- Using this tool to scan systems without explicit written authorization
- Distributing modified versions with actual exploit payloads
- Using this tool for malicious purposes or cybercrime
- Bypassing security controls on systems you don't own

## ✅ Authorized Use Guidelines

You may legally use this tool when:

✅ You own the target system  
✅ You have written permission from the system owner  
✅ You are conducting authorized penetration testing under contract  
✅ You are testing your own applications in a controlled environment  
✅ You are a security researcher with explicit bug bounty authorization  

## 🌐 Legal Compliance

Users are solely responsible for compliance with:

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - United States
- GDPR Article 32 - European Union
- Computer Misuse Act - United Kingdom
- Local computer crime laws in your jurisdiction
- Terms of Service of target systems

## 📜 License Restrictions

The MIT license **does not grant permission** to:
- Use this tool for illegal activities
- Scan systems without authorization
- Distribute weaponized versions with actual exploits

## 💡 Security Best Practices

When using this tool:

1. Always obtain **written authorization** before scanning
2. Maintain detailed records of permission scope
3. Never scan production systems without change control approval
4. Use isolated test environments whenever possible
5. Report findings responsibly to system owners
6. Never share vulnerability details publicly before patching

## 🤝 Working with Security Researchers

We encourage responsible security research. If you:

- Discover vulnerabilities **in applications** using this tool
- Find false positives/negatives in detection logic
- Identify missing vulnerability patterns

→ Please open a GitHub Issue with the label `enhancement` or `detection-improvement`

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

> The authors and contributors of this tool expressly disclaim liability for any misuse. Users assume full responsibility for legal compliance. This tool is provided "as is" for authorized security testing only. Using this tool against systems without explicit permission may violate computer crime laws and result in criminal prosecution.
